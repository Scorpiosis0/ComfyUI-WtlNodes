Hi, I made this node pack because I wanted :)

**Nodes list ⬇️**

Dual Ease Cosine Scheduler:
This node is a custom scheduler I made that needs further testing. It's been tested using FID (fréchet inception distance) along ablation to find the rought best default values.

Settings ⚙️:
- steps : controls how many steps will be made
- sigma_max : controls the maximum sigma (max noise)
- min_sigma : controls the minimum sigma (min noise)
- rho_start : controls the strenght of the easing curve at the top
- rho_end : controls the strenght of the easing curve at the bottom
